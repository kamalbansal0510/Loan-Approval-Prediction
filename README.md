# Loan Eligibility Prediction
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Overview

This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the eligibility of loan applicants based on various features. The system automates the loan approval process for a finance company, providing an efficient solution for assessing loan applications.
## Project Workflow

1. Problem Understanding: Analyze the business problem of automating loan approvals based on applicant data.

2. Data Collection: Utilize a dataset containing features like applicant income, education, marital status, etc.

3. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Model Training: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using the processed training data.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the test data to ensure accuracy.

6. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict loan eligibility for new applicants.
## Dependencies

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Google Collaboratory (optional)
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i (1).csv, containing features such as income, education, marital status, etc., which are crucial for predicting loan eligibility.
## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 83.33% on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting loan eligibility.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in automating business processes, particularly in the finance sector, by building a robust loan status prediction system.
